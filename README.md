# Gonzaga-Hackathon-2023
My personal submission to the Gonzaga University Hackathon in 2023.

The objective of the Hackathon was to write a new project from scratch in about 10 hours of time. For my project I decided to make a small game based around avoiding other goats and collecting metal cans to score points.
To do this in the terminal, I implemented the Ncurses ASCII art user interface libraries, which I had never used before. By the end of the project I had coded:

  - An adjustable board that could be resized however the user wished
  - A player-character goat
  - An enemy NPC goat, which chased the player and in some cases could even charge at them
